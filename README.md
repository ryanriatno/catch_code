# catch_code
## Tech Stack
This project are using `React` and `Parcel` as a bundler and using jest + react testing library.
* [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
* [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/)
We don't need to use create react app as this is just a simple project and we don't need webpack for this.

## How to Run
* Clone the repo
* Invoke `yarn`
* Run `yarn start` to start
* Run `yarn test` to start unit tests
